## Task 3: Intercepting and Manipulating Traffic

Performed ARP spoofing simulation and intercepted HTTP traffic using:
- `urlsnarf` – captured victim’s GET/POST requests to `http://192.168.0.192:8000`
- `dsniff` – ready for credential interception (not required as `urlsnarf` already captured traffic)

Victim submitted credentials successfully, confirmed via server output.

> All activities performed in a closed, local lab environment. No external systems were targeted.
