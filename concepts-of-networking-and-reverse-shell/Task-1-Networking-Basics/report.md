# Task 1: Networking Basics

## What is a Network?
A network is a group of two or more connected devices that can share resources and data.  
**Example**: Home Wi-Fi connecting your laptop, phone, and smart TV.

## Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small area like home/office.  
  _Example: College lab computers_
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Spans cities/countries.  
  _Example: The Internet_
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: City-wide.  
  _Example: City-wide CCTV network_

## What is a Protocol?
A set of rules that govern how data is transmitted between devices.  
**Example**: HTTP tells your browser how to load a webpage.

## Common Network Protocols
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-based (e.g., web browsing)
- **UDP**: Fast, connectionless (e.g., video calls)
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web communication
- **FTP**: File transfer
- **DNS**: Converts domain names to IP addresses

## What is an IP Address?
A unique numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).

## What is a Subnet?
A logical subdivision of an IP network.  
_Example_: `192.168.1.0/24` allows 254 devices in one group.

## What is a Router?
Device that forwards data between networks.  
_Example_: Home Wi-Fi router connects your LAN to the Internet.

## What is a Switch?
Connects devices within the same network (LAN).  
_Example_: Office switch linking 20 workstations.

## Key Takeaways
- Networks enable communication and resource sharing.
- Protocols ensure standardized communication.
- IP addressing and subnetting help organize large networks.
- Routers (inter-network) ≠ Switches (intra-network).
